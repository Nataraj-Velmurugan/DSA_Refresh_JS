// Input: N = 4, arr[] = [5, 2, 6, 4], diff = 3
// Output: 1
// Explanation: We can only have a single partition which is shown below:
// {5, 2} and {6, 4} such that S1 = 7 and S2 = 10 and thus the difference is 3

// Input: N = 5, arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 1, 2], diff = 1
// Output: 5
// Explanation: We can have five partitions which is shown below
// {1, 3, 1} and {2, 2} – S1 = 5, S2 = 4
// {1, 2, 2} and {1, 3} – S1 = 5, S2 = 4
// {3, 2} and {1, 1, 2} – S1 = 5, S2 = 4
// {1, 2, 2} and {1, 3} – S1 = 5, S2 = 4
// {3, 2} and {1, 1, 2} – S1 = 5, S2 = 4
